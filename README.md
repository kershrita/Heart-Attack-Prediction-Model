# Heart Attack Prediction Model

The Heart Attack Prediction Model is a machine learning solution designed to predict the likelihood of a person experiencing a heart attack based on various risk factors and health parameters. It aims to assist in early detection and proactive intervention to prevent heart-related health issues.

Heart attacks are a significant health concern worldwide. Early detection and prediction of heart attack risks can enable timely intervention and reduce the chances of severe health consequences. This machine learning model utilizes a dataset of various risk factors, such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health parameters, to predict the probability of a heart attack occurrence.

## Installation

To get started with the Heart Attack Prediction Model, follow these steps:

1. Clone or Download the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/kershrita/Heart-Attack-Prediction-Model.git
```
2. Install the necessary libraries:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Usage

2. Prepare the heart attack dataset for training. Ensure that the dataset contains relevant features and labeled data indicating the occurrence of heart attacks.
3. Perform data preprocessing tasks, such as handling missing values, scaling numerical features, and encoding categorical variables, to prepare the dataset for training.
4. Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the machine learning model's performance.
5. Select a suitable machine learning algorithm, such as logistic regression, random forest, or support vector machines, and train the model using the training dataset.
6. Evaluate the model's performance using the testing dataset by calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.
7. Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be used to predict the probability of heart attacks for new individuals based on their health parameters.
